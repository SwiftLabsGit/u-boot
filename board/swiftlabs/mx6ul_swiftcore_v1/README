How to use U-Boot on Swift Labs Inc. Swiftcore V1
-----------------------------------------------

- Build U-Boot for Swiftcore V1:

$ make mrproper
$ make mx6ul_swiftcore_v1_defconfig
$ make

This will generate the SPL image called SPL and the u-boot.img.

- Flash the SPL image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/sdc bs=1k seek=1; sync

- Flash the u-boot.img image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sdc bs=1k seek=69; sync

- Connect a USB cable to the micro USB port on the Swiftcore for serial console

- Insert the micro SD card in the board, power it up and U-Boot messages should appear.
